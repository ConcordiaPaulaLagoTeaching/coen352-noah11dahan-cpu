# GitHub Basics — Reflection

## What I learned
- A **repository** is the project folder on GitHub that stores files and the full history of changes.
- **Cloning** makes a local copy of a repo on my computer so I can edit with my own tools and sync changes back to GitHub.
- A **commit** is a saved checkpoint of changes with a message explaining what I did.
- A **push** uploads my commits from my computer to GitHub so others (or my teacher) can see them.
- **Branches** let me work on changes separately from `main` so I don’t risk breaking the main version.
- A **pull request (PR)** is how you propose merging branch changes into `main` and get review/feedback.
- **Issues** are a way to track tasks, bugs, and improvements in a project.
- **Markdown** is simple formatting used in README files, issues, and PRs.

## What I’m still unsure about
- When it’s best to commit directly to `main` vs. always creating a branch first.
- How teachers typically grade Classroom repos (commits vs PRs vs GitHub Actions).

## What I submitted
- I created `reflection.md` and committed it to the GitHub Classroom repository.
